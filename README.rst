This repository is for homework assignments for `Numerical Software Development
(NYCU 2024 autumn)
<https://yyc.solvcon.net/en/latest/nsd/schedule/24au_nycu/schedule24au.html>`__.

To turn in your submission, you need to clone this repository, and create a
`pull request (PR) <https://github.com/yungyuc/nsdhw_24au/pulls>`__.  Your
cloned repository needs to be public on GitHub.  The branch of your PR needs to
start with ``<github-user-name>-hw#``, e.g., ``myname-hw2-attempt1``.

If you are new to GitHub, the GitHub Actions workflow for your homework
submission will need to be `approved before your first PR is merged
<https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/managing-your-repositorys-settings-and-features/enabling-features-for-your-repository/managing-github-actions-settings-for-a-repository#controlling-changes-from-forks-to-workflows-in-public-repositories>`__.

The code in your PR should not duplicate with your classmates'.  Once
duplication is found, the latter submitter should modify the code.  One way to
avoid the hassle is to submit as early as possible.
