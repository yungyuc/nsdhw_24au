## Term Project: Eigenvalue Approximation Using Gersgorin Theorem
This project focuses on approximating eigenvalues of large matrices using the Gersgorin Circle Theorem.
The approach includes dimensionality reduction techniques like PCA and SVD. 
My goal is to first write my own PCA and SVD methods and aim for them to be faster than existing packages. 
After learning how to implement PCA and SVD, I hope to apply my mathematical knowledge of the Gersgorin Theorem 
to see if the approximation method can be faster. 
The repository contains the code and detailed explanation for applying this method to practical datasets.

About:
  First step:
    I will first try to write the basic spectral decomposition and SVD code to use in PCA, and find out the problems in the field (ML/Finance/Genetic information)
    where I want to test the effect as a test case, and record the time and results of this approach.

  second step:
    I will try to use Gersgorin Theorem to find eigenvalue approximation to do spectral,
    hope can speed up PCA compression as much as possible while sacrificing the least accuracy,
    then provide APIs for related applications that will be used!
    In my imagination, if the matrix dimensions to be processed today reach the level of millions of rows and columns,
    it may be very troublesome and slow to calculate the eigenvalues!
    So I thought about the matrix theory course I took in college, in which Gersgorin Theorem mentioned 
    that all eigenvalues ​​will fall within certain specific circles.
    I thought if I could shrink this circle as much as possible through other methods 
    (or is not narrowed, but the guess is accurate enough within the range) 
    I have the opportunity to avoid the tedious calculation of eigenvalues ​​and further do PCA

  Final step:
    I will compare two method, and analysis it!
    And the baseline will be:
      1.SVD Baseline: The Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) baseline is implemented using the numpy.linalg.svd() 
      function from the NumPy library
      2.PCA Baseline: For Principal Component Analysis (PCA), we use the sklearn.decomposition.PCA() 
      function from the Scikit-learn library.

Problem to Solve
================
First, I will learn how to do SVD decomposition and spectral decomposition for use in PCA.
I will also survey the current methods of SVD decomposition and spectral decomposition, compare and improve them.
second,I hope I still have time to add Gersgorin Theorem's method to compare and see if 
I can sacrifice some accuracy for faster speed.

So,the project has two tasks want to reach,first is speed up the PCA and SVD decomposition,
the second aims to solve the problem of calculating eigenvalues ​​and dimensionality reduction of 
large matrices. This problem is very common in machine learning, numerical linear algebra 
and scientific computing. Especially in natural language processing (NLP), genetic data analysis 
and big data processing, as the size of data grows, the limitations of existing tools 
in terms of speed and memory consumption become increasingly obvious.

We will apply Gersgorin Theorem to estimate the eigenvalues ​​of large matrices, 
and then perform dimensionality reduction through principal component analysis (PCA)

Introduce of Gersgorin Theorem:s a theory used to approximate the eigenvalues ​​of matrices. 
This theorem states that given a complex matrix A ,All eigenvalues ​​of a matrix lie within some specific disks on the plane, 
these disks are called Gersgorin disks.

Prospective Users
=================
I expect that the calculation time can be shortened and efficiency improved in data-intensive research 
(such as genetic data analysis, text analysis of large corpora). Since I have reduced the accuracy a little 
in exchange for faster calculation speed, I expect I hope that my project can serve as a pilot test for 
these data-intensive research ideas; I also hope that it can enable personal computers to do tasks such as 
training large-scale NLP.

In addition, I will also apply it to financial modeling, machine learning and big data processing, 
and use my project to reduce memory and computing costs in the data processing process. 
I hope it can have more practical application value.

And the baseline will be the method mentioned above from my survey
and the traditional svd decomposition and spectral decomposition that I have improved.


System Architecture
===================

1.input and output
  input:(massive) matrix , When inputting a larger matrix, 
  I plan to use either Incremental SVD or memory mapping to address memory limitations. 
  I am not yet certain which approach will be better, so I will experiment to find the optimal solution. 
  The goal is to determine which method is more suitable for handling large matrix inputs.
  Regarding the matrix size of one million rows, I derived this number from large language model datasets. 
  Initially, I will experiment with smaller matrices to ensure feasibility. However, 
  my ultimate goal is to work with matrices of this scale. If this proves too impractical, 
  I would be open to suggestions and feedback on how to adjust my approach.

  output:
    1.The low-dimensional matrix reduced by PCA and SVD with general solution(means not approximate)
    2.The approximate eigenvalues ​​estimated by Gersgorin Theorem, and the low-dimensional matrix reduced by PCA
