Advanced Vector Search for RAG Systems
======================================

Basic Information
-----------------
This `project <https://github.com/SUNGOD3/AdvancedVectorSearch>`__, tentatively named "AdvancedVectorSearch", aims to develop and implement novel vector search methods for RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) systems.

The nature of LLM (Large Language Model) technology introduces unpredictability in LLM responses. Additionally, LLM training data is static and introduces a cut-off date on the knowledge it has. (e.g. Instagram's parent company is called Meta, but an LLM trained only on pre-2020 data would answer Facebook.)

RAG combines the power of LLM with information retrieval systems. It works by:

1. Retrieving relevant information from a knowledge base: This step involves converting the user's query into a vector representation and then searching the knowledge base for the most similar vectors.
2. Feeding this information to the LLM along with the user's query.
3. Having the LLM generate a response based on both the retrieved information and its pre-trained knowledge.

Vector search is a crucial component in modern information retrieval systems, particularly in RAG applications. While FAISS (Facebook AI Similarity Search) is a well-established library for efficient similarity search, there's room for innovation in search methodologies. 
   

.. note:: 

   The goal of this project will focus on vector search, similarity comparison function, vector data storage, and does not include matrix calculations of LLM.

Problem to Solve
----------------
The primary challenges this project aims to address are:

1. Improving search speed beyond basic linear search, especially for high-dimensional vector spaces common in RAG systems.
2. Developing new similarity metrics that may be more suitable for specific RAG applications.
3. Creating a flexible, extensible framework that allows for easy experimentation with different search algorithms and metrics.
4. Balancing speed, accuracy, and memory usage in vector search operations.

Prospective Users
-----------------
This project will benefit:

1. Researchers and developers working on RAG systems.
2. Data scientists and machine learning engineers dealing with large-scale similarity search problems.
3. Information retrieval specialists looking for customizable vector search solutions.
4. Anyone working with high-dimensional data requiring efficient similarity search capabilities.
5. Graduate students who lack a graduation thesis.

System Architecture
-------------------
The AdvancedVectorSearch system will consist of the following components:

1. Dataset Module: For generating and managing large-scale, high-dimensional vector datasets for testing and benchmarking.
2. Index Module: Implementing various similarity comparison functions and indexing structures.
3. Search Module: Providing add and search functionalities with support for different search algorithms.
4. Benchmark Module: For comparing the implemented methods against linear search and potentially FAISS in terms of speed, accuracy, and memory usage.

The system will be implemented in C++ for core functionalities, with Python bindings for ease of use.
